Hi THere.

So this is a Simple Windows KeyLogger that records all keystokes on your keyboard and saves them to a file that it's creates automatically when compiled

The Callback checks for the Key Up Event and then records what action was made

You can compile it in your command line 'cl' + 'file_naame'
To check whether it's running open your Task Bar and scroll to the very bottom of your background Tasks...It should be there.
To terminate this program type 'ALT' + '9'

Language: C++


NOTE: This is just an Experiment
